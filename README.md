Crackme Solutions
=================
As both a fun undertaking and a way to improve my understanding of computers I've been working my way through various [Crackmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackme). 

Within this repository you will find a directory for each of the solved Crackmes containing the following:

* Readme file with an explanation of how the Crackme was solved and where it can be downloaded (see warning below).
* Solution files, usually in the form of source-code.

This is a continuous learning process for me, so if you see an improvement to a solution or an error in an explanation then be sure to tell me.

Warning
-------
My anti-virus flags some of the Crackmes (and/or their supporting files) as malicious, so take care if you do choose to follow the the download links I provide with each solution. I personally do all my cracking within a sandbox VM.
